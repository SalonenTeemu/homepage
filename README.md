## Running the application

The website is deployed with Vercel.

### Notes on the projects page

The projects page includes some miscellaneous projects that I wanted to add to the website. Below are short explanations of them and links to their original GitHub repositories.

#### ai-chess

Chess application designed for users to play against an AI opponent. The AI is powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The application allows the player to play as white or black, select from three different AI difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), undo moves and reset the game. The app also includes sound effects for moves, captures, checkmate etc.

#### ai-chatbot

Simple AI chatbot implemented with Google Gemini API using the 1.5 Flash model. You can type messages and it will answer them. It was interesting to test how AI can be used in web development. **Remember to not give any personal information to the chatbot.**

#### premier-league-app

English Premier League football application showing the league table and matches. The app shows the standings table of the current season as well as all fixtures of the season and their respective results. The application uses [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/) to fetch the data for the standings and matches.

#### f1-race-schedule-app

A simple Formula 1 race schedule application. The app shows 2024 season race dates, times and locations. It shows which races have already been finished, what race is coming next and the races upcoming later in the season. The application uses [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) to fetch the race schedule data. [The Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) is deprecated and will only be updated until the end of the 2024 season so sadly the application will not work after 2024.
