# Homepage

This is my homepage. It's build with Next.js and hosted at [salonenteemu.fi](https://salonenteemu.fi).

## Running the application

Run the app with `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the project root directory. The application doesn't have database or other dependencies.

### Application deployment

The website is deployed with Vercel.

### Notes on the projects page

The projects page includes some miscellaneous projects that I have or will be adding to the website. Below are short explanations of them and links to their original GitHub repositories.

#### f1-race-schedule-app

A simple Formula 1 race schedule application. The app shows 2024 season race dates, times and locations. It shows which races have already been finished, what race is coming next and the races upcoming later in the season. The application uses [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) to fetch the race schedule data. [The Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) is deprecated and will only be updated until the end of the 2024 season so sadly the application will not work after 2024.
