### Notes on the projects page

The projects page includes some miscellaneous projects that I wanted to add to the website. Below are short explanations of them and links to their original GitHub repositories.

#### ai-chess

Chess application designed for users to play against an AI opponent. The AI is powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The application allows the player to play as white or black, select from three different AI difficulty level (easy, medium, hard), undo moves and reset the game. The app also includes sound effects for moves, captures, checkmate etc.
